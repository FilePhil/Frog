## Install it from source
You can install Lens by compiling from source, here's the list of dependencies required:
 - `gtk+-3.0>=3.22.29`
 - `granite>=6.1`
 - `glib-2.0`
 - `gobject-2.0`
 - `meson`
 - `python>=3.6`

## Building

I'm the guy who loves GUI tools instead of command-line thus I recommend using [Builder](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Builder) to develop applications.
To build the Lens application just open project folder in Builder and press "Execute" (F5). It will download requirements and build the app.
